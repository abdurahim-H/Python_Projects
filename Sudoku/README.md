# 🧩 Sudoku: Unleash Your Inner Puzzle Master! 🧩

Welcome to our Sudoku game! This isn't just any Sudoku game, it's a journey into the world of complex puzzles and challenging riddles. Whether you're a seasoned Sudoku veteran or a newcomer to the game, we've got you covered. 

Our game includes a powerful Sudoku solver that uses a backtracking algorithm to solve any valid Sudoku puzzle. But that's not all! You can also play the game yourself in the terminal, testing your logic and problem-solving skills. 

## 🎮 How to Play

The game starts with a partially filled Sudoku board. The empty spots are marked with 'X'. Your task is to fill in the empty spots with numbers from 1 to 9.

To make a move, you need to enter the row number (1-9), the column number (1-9), and the number you want to place in that spot (1-9). If your move is valid, the number will be placed on the board. If not, you'll be asked to try again.

The game continues until you've filled in all the spots and solved the Sudoku, or until you choose to exit the game.

## 🚀 How to Run

To run the game, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and type `python main.py` in the terminal.

## 📚 Requirements

This game requires Python 3. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website.
